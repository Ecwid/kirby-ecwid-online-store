2. In the Ecwid widget in your Kirby Admin Panel, click the Connect button to connect your Ecwid account to your site.
3. Once our account is connected, the plugin will try to create a new “Shop” page on your site for you automatically. If a page is not created, you can create a Shop page yourself: just create a page and choose “Ecwid” template in the page creation dialog.
